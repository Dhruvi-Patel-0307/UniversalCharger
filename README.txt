Here, I would like to describe the journey of the project.
First of all, I read about a project on October 7.and think about it. but I did not do anything because I needed more time to understand.
On October 8,I started thinking about the names of my companies and products and doing research on them.Then it was done for that day.
After that, I start making repostaries and choose options and extentions.Then I commented on the line in the json file and ran the code, so I got the welcome page.
Then I started following your instructions.
and make different kinds of CSS files and edit them.
but in the 3rd step, I got an error just because I forgot to link my product name, UniversalCharger, at onelocation and also forgot to change the namespace.
I tried 2-3 times, and then finally I corrected my errors.
Then finally, it was time to add 10 products, so I added 10 products to index.cshtml.also link each other so I can get output.
I was tired that day, so I put my code there, and my project is almost done.
but I do not put CSSSo I changed the CSS, and it took around 30 minutes, and my project looks very good.
That's the end.My project has a good look.
and then it's time to submit with GitHub.
It was an amazing experience to do this project.
thank you
